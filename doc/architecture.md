# AlJefra OS -- System Architecture

## Vision

AlJefra OS is a **self-evolving exokernel** that boots on any device -- desktops, laptops, tablets, single-board computers, and servers -- across x86-64, ARM64, and RISC-V 64 architectures. The core insight is simple: we only need enough built-in drivers to establish network connectivity, then an AI agent handles everything else by downloading and installing drivers from the AlJefra Driver Marketplace.

This document describes the architecture of AlJefra OS v0.7.5, covering the layer model, design principles, directory structure, supported platforms, boot sequence, driver model, and AI bootstrap flow.

## Layer Diagram

The system is organized into six horizontal layers. Each layer depends only on the layer directly below it.

## Design Principles

### 1. HAL Abstraction

All hardware access goes through the Hardware Abstraction Layer. Code above Layer 1 never uses inline assembly, architecture-specific registers, or platform-specific constants. This means every driver, the kernel, the network stack, and the AI agent compile identically for all three architectures.

See [hal_spec.md](hal_spec.md) for the complete API specification.

### 2. Minimal Boot Drivers

The kernel ships with only the drivers needed to establish network connectivity:

- One storage driver (to load the kernel itself)
- One network driver (to reach the marketplace)
- One display driver (for early console output)
- Basic input (PS/2 keyboard for emergency interaction)

Everything else is downloaded from the marketplace after boot.

### 3. Driver Hot-Loading

Drivers can be loaded and unloaded at runtime without rebooting. The driver model uses a `driver_ops_t` structure with `init()` and `shutdown()` callbacks, allowing clean insertion and removal. Runtime drivers are packaged as `.ajdrv` files.

### 4. AI-First Configuration

Instead of requiring the user to know their hardware and manually install drivers, AlJefra OS uses an AI agent to:

1. Scan all buses (PCI, USB, platform) and build a hardware manifest.
2. Connect to the AlJefra Driver Marketplace over the first working network path.
3. Register the machine and queue missing drivers/apps.
4. Send the manifest and receive a list of matching drivers.
5. Download, verify, load, and configure each driver automatically.

The user experience is: plug in, power on, wait, done.

### 5. Exokernel Philosophy

The kernel exposes hardware capabilities with minimal abstraction overhead. Drivers and applications can opt into direct hardware access through well-defined HAL interfaces, giving them maximum performance while maintaining portability.

## Boot Sequence

```
+------------------+
|    Firmware       |   BIOS, UEFI, SBI, or DTB
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
|   Bootloader     |   Pure64 (x86), GRUB, or firmware direct
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
|    boot.S        |   Set up stack, clear BSS, jump to C
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
|   hal_init()     |   Console -> CPU -> MMU -> IRQ -> Timer -> Bus -> SMP
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| kernel_main()    |   Print banner, scan buses, load built-in drivers

+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| AI Bootstrap     |   Build manifest -> sync machine -> connect store -> download drivers
+--------+---------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
|  System Ready    |   All drivers loaded, desktop starts, AI chat available
+------------------+
```

See [boot_protocol.md](boot_protocol.md) for per-architecture boot details.

## Driver Model

Every AlJefra driver is a C module that exposes a `driver_ops_t` structure. The kernel calls its callbacks to initialize, operate, and shut down the driver.

### driver_ops_t Structure

```c
typedef enum {
    DRIVER_STORAGE,
    DRIVER_NETWORK,
    DRIVER_INPUT,
    DRIVER_DISPLAY,
    DRIVER_BUS
} driver_category_t;

typedef struct {
    const char         *name;        /* Human-readable driver name        */
    driver_category_t   category;    /* Driver category                   */
    hal_status_t      (*init)(void); /* Called once at load time           */
    void              (*shutdown)(void); /* Called at unload time          */

    /* Category-specific operations (union or tagged struct) */
    union {
        struct {
            int (*read)(uint64_t lba, uint32_t count, void *buf);
            int (*write)(uint64_t lba, uint32_t count, const void *buf);
            uint64_t (*capacity)(void);
        } storage;

        struct {
            int (*send)(const void *pkt, uint32_t len);
            int (*recv)(void *buf, uint32_t max_len);
            void (*get_mac)(uint8_t mac[6]);
        } network;

        struct {
            int (*poll)(void *event);
        } input;

        struct {
            int (*set_mode)(uint32_t width, uint32_t height, uint32_t bpp);
            void *(*get_framebuffer)(void);
            void (*flip)(void);
        } display;

        struct {
            int (*scan)(void (*callback)(hal_device_t *dev));
        } bus;
    } ops;
} driver_ops_t;
```

### Driver Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** -- The kernel or AI agent determines that a driver is needed (via PCI vendor/device ID match or marketplace query).
2. **Loading** -- For built-in drivers, the `init()` function is called directly. For runtime drivers (`.ajdrv`), the binary is loaded into memory first.
3. **Registration** -- The driver registers its `driver_ops_t` with the kernel driver manager.
4. **Operation** -- The kernel and applications use the category-specific ops to interact with the hardware.
5. **Shutdown** -- When the driver is no longer needed (or being replaced), `shutdown()` is called for clean teardown.

See [driver_guide.md](driver_guide.md) for the complete driver development guide.

## AI Bootstrap Flow

The AI bootstrap is what makes AlJefra OS unique. After the network is up, the following sequence executes:

```
1.  Scan PCI bus           -->  List of (vendor_id, device_id, class, subclass) tuples
2.  Scan USB bus           -->  List of (vendor_id, product_id, class) tuples
3.  Scan platform devices  -->  List of compatible strings (from DTB on ARM/RISC-V)
4.  Build JSON manifest    -->  { "arch": "x86_64", "devices": [ ... ] }
5.  DHCP (already done)    -->  IP address, gateway, DNS server
6.  DNS resolve            -->  Resolve marketplace API endpoint
7.  Connect to store       -->  HTTPS POST manifest to store.aljefra.com/api/match
8.  Receive driver list    -->  [ { "name": "nvidia-rtx4090", "url": "...", "sha256": "..." }, ... ]
9.  Download .ajdrv files  -->  Fetch each driver binary
10. Verify signatures      -->  Check SHA-256 hash and Ed25519 signature
11. Load into memory       -->  Map driver code, relocate symbols
12. Call driver init()     -->  Driver takes over its hardware
13. Report status          -->  Log success/failure for each driver
```

If the network is unavailable, the system continues with built-in drivers only and retries the AI bootstrap periodically.
